# SwipeForce

Swipe Force is a Tinder-like app that allows Sales people / Salesforce users to easily view and manage leads on the go. 

Users can swipe left to remove leads, swipe down to save leads for later, and swipe right to move leads into accepted group. Leads in the Recycled, Later, and Accepted groups can still be swiped left and right to move between these groups. 

This app will require integrations with: 

 * [x] Salesforce to pull leads data. 
 * [x] LinkedIn to pull profile image, if available. 

If we can achieve the basic features and still have additional time, we will consider other nice-to-have features:

 * [x] Interactive graphs on the profile details view. 
 * [x] Calendar to show activities from the past. 
 * [x] Add notes
 * [x] See common connections via Linkedin
 * [x] Send and receive messages
