# SwipeForce

Swipe Force is a Tinder-like app that allows Sales people / Salesforce users to easily view and manage leads on the go. 

Users can swipe left to remove leads, swipe down to save leads for later, and swipe right to move leads into accepted group. Leads in the Recyclec, Later, and Accepted groups can still be swiped left and right to move between these groups. 

This app will require integrations: 

 * [x] Salesforce integration to pull leads data. 
 * [x] LinkedIn integration to pull profile image, if available.
